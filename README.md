<h2>Helicopter Animation Project</h2>
<p>This project features a 3D helicopter simulation with interactive animations. The helicopter's rotor blades rotate continuously, creating a realistic flight effect. Users can control various aspects of the simulation using keyboard and mouse inputs:</p>
<li>Camera Rotation: Pressing the left arrow (←) and right arrow (→) keys rotates the camera clockwise and anticlockwise, respectively.</li>
<li>Takeoff & Landing: Pressing the up arrow (↑) key makes the helicopter take off, while pressing the down arrow (↓) key initiates landing.</li>
<li>Lighting Effects: With each mouse click, the light source moves around the helicopter, enhancing the visual effects.</li>
<li>Sound Effects: Distinct sound effects accompany both the takeoff and landing actions for an immersive experience.</li>
<br>
<b>Technologies Used:</b>
<li>Development Tools: Visual Studio Code (for coding), Blender (for model design)</li>
<li>Library: Three.js</li>
<li>Runtime Environment: Node.js</li>
<li>Programming Languages: HTML, JavaScript</li>
